            Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant,
            focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist.
            Our chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu
            of 12â€“15 dishes rotated seasonally.
            <br /><br />
            Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian,
            who moved to the United States to establish their unique restaurant.
            Mario strives on his experience as a lead chef in one of the biggest
            restaurants in Italy. Little Lemon goes beyond classic Italian and incorporates
            additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
